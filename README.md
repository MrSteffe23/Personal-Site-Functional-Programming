# Personal-Site-Functional-Programming

I made this project for a Functional Programming class.   

The page starts with **contact details**. Then, the events are shown in a **timeline that includes all events sorted in chronological order**. The user is able to **select which event categories to show in the timeline**.    

The main goal of the project was to get hands-on experience for building a close to real-world app, that displays useful data, can retrieve data from a server and has a decent test suite to ensure that it works properly.
